\begin{abstract}
    This thesis aims to deepen the understanding of the functioning of convolutional neural networks and how these deep learning models are able to extract significant information from genomic sequences, analyzing their non-coding regions. In particular, three CNN-based tools — DeepSEA, Basset and DeepSATA — will be compared and a review of their performance will be provided.
